Here we aim to teach you the fundamentals of how to collect and organise data in a clean and sensible format and how to correctly visualise and describe data. The platform we will be using to manage, manipulate and analyse data is RStudioCloud. This is a cloud based interface utilises the programming language R. Over the course of the next few weeks you will start to learn fundamentals of this language and its application in RStudioCloud. 1.2 How to use this workbook The Data Handling sub-module is composed of a combination of lectures and workshops. Here we will aim to cover fundamentals of data organisation and visualisation in semester 1 and in semester 2 we will move onto some slighlty more advanced data visualisation skills, descriptive statistics and data interpretation. We will briefly touch on inferential statistics towards the end of the year, but this will be a very brief introduction. Each week is accompanied by a chapter in this workbook and you will be expected to complete these exercises in your own time. The exercises shouldn’t take more then an hour but as with learning any new skill, the more you put in the more you get out. 1.3 Why is data handling important and why are we teaching it in R? It is a common misconception that to be a good biologist you need to ‘know’ the mechanics of how life works. Questions like; “How does a cell undergo respiration?” “How do kidneys filter blood?” “How do some plants fix nitrogen?” and “How do honey bees communicate the location and quantity of resources to each other?” spring to mind. While these questions are important, they are also, now, fairly well understood. But how did biologists come to their understanding of these mechanisms? The answer to this lies in data. Good science is based on empirical observations and these observations should be reliably collected and reproducible. Exploration of theories through observations and experimentation leads to the collection of data and analysis and interpretation of data feeds into the bedrock of our understanding of the principals of how life works, i.e. the biological sciences. So why are we teaching you how to handle data using R? To many of you the use of programming languages, such as R, will be new. However if you can get into the habit of manipulating and analysing data in R you will be well set on the path to becoming an efficient and effective data analyst. Knowledge and experience of programming languages such as R are fast becoming key skills in the sciences and beyond, and they are highly valued by employers. You may also have noticed that the term “reproducible” recurring on this page. In the same way that your methods of data collection, when performing a scientific observation or experiment, should be conducted and recorded in such a way that they may be reproduced by others, your data manipulation and analysis must also be conducted and recorded so as to be reproducible. Using RStudioCloud makes it easy to record your data manipulation and analysis workflow and, if done well, makes it very easy for others to see and repeat what you have done.

However, why reinvent the wheel trying to write your own complex scripts, when a lot of very clever coders have already written collections of scripts stored in packages that will do the job for you. As the course progresses you will use a range of packages that contain functions. Functions can be thought of as a small piece of code that is designed to perform a set task. For example the data visualisation package (which you will become very familiar with as the course progresses) ggplot2 contains ranges of functions which allow you to define how your plot or graph will look, for example geom_bar is a function within the ggplot2 package that contains the instructions required to build a bar chart. 3.1 Installing and calling packages 3.2 Using functions 3.3 What do I do if I get an error message?
