# New year, new data - Workshop 4 - Athletes, Week 2B

Good news! There are only four chapters remaining. Each chapter from this point on wards is associated with a timetabled 2 hour workshop. However if you don't complete a chapter in the timetabled time you are expected to complete it at home. Here we have material for Workshop 4 in Week 2 of Semester 2.

## A new project

We will be working on two new data sets this term and for each one you will be asked to produce a mock project result section. These wont be marked, but will help you prepare for the Skills for Biologists Summative and other reports that you will produce through your university career. You can ask for feedback from either myself or demonstrators during your workshop sessions. 

In this project you are interested in exploring the differences and relationships in weight, height and red blood cell in a group of male and female athletes. 

### Project setup

Generally I recommend starting a new R Project every time you start working on new and unrelated data sets. Go to posit Cloud and open a **New Project** and name it `athletes`. Spend a few minutes setting up your workspace, refer back to **Section 4.3** to remind yourself of how to do this. Remember you will need to create sensible places to save scrips, data and figures to. You will also need to freshly install any required packages. 

For todays workshop you will need the following packages:

* tidyverse
* patchwork

### The data

The data we will be working on was collected from 202 athletes (102 male (m) and 100 female (f)). 

The following variables were measured for each athlete:

* height (ht) was recorded in cm
* weight (wt) was recorded in kg
* red blood cell count (rcc) in 10^12^l^-1^

You can download the new data set [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/ellenbell/4008Y/blob/main/data/athletes.csv). When downloaded you will need to unzip the file, save it somewhere sensible on your computer and then load it in to posit cloud (see **Section 4.4** if you are unsure). 

### Script set up

Its fairly safe to say we will be creating some new scripts so open a new **R script** and set it up as described in **Section 4.5**. The project title will be *An analysis of red cell counts among athletes*. Remember to use `library()` to load your freshly installed packages. 

## Explore the data

We finished last terms workshops by looking at how we can cannibalise code to fit our purposes. We will be spending the first part of todays workshop going over a few of these skills on our shiney new data set! It may be helpful to look through some of the scripts in **Section 12** if you get stuck.

### Task 1 - Look at your data distributions

Its always helpful to look at how your data is distributed, as this could have implication for how you tackle downstream analysis. 

Create a histogram for the following variables, start with a 6 bins and then make a second set of histogams with 20 bins:

* Athlete height
* Athlete weight
* Athlete red blood cell count

> **Pitt Stop; pause your analysis and check your interpretation**
> Compare your six histograms;
> How would you describe each plot?
> How does changing the bin size effect the shape of the plot?
> Look at your histogram for red blood cell count with 20 bins, why do you think it looks like this?

<details><summary> **Click-me to check your interpretation** </summary>

Your histograms for height and weight both appear normally distributed. Changing the number of bins doesn't really alter this. However when you look at the histogram for red blood cell count with 6 bins it looks like it might be sightly skewed, with 20 bins however we get more resolution over the data distribution and two peaks appear. The red blood cell count data are bi-modal. This suggest that we may need to think about our data a little more. These histograms were performed on all the data, which includes both male and female athletes, the bi-modal distribution suggests we should consider splitting the data and analysing male and female athletes separately. 

</details>

So lets have a think about how we could split out data set up to examine male and female athletes separately.

Make sure the tidyverse package is installed **and** loaded and try using this chunk, note that I have called my initial data frame `athletes` you may have named yours something else;

```{r}

# Pipe your data set to the filter function, this will pull out the male athletes and store then in a new object.
male_athletes <- athletes %>%
  filter(sex == "m")

```
**Note that %>% used here is just another notation for piping, rather like the + that ggplot uses.This means that the output from one function is fed into the next function.**

Make a similar data frame for female athletes using the above chunk. Then create two new histograms for:

* Male athlete red blood cell count
* Female athlete red blood cell count

> **Pitt Stop; pause your analysis and check your interpretation**
> How would you describe these two new histograms?

### Task 2 - Look for differences and relationships

Now that we have a better idea for how our data are distributed we can start to ask some questions of the data set. First of all think, what kind of plot would you build to explore the following questions? We covered this in *Section 7.1*.

* Is there a difference between male and female athlete height?
* Is there a difference between male and female athlete weight?
* Is there a difference between male and female athlete red blood cell count?
* Is there a relationship between height and weight in male and female athletes?
* Is there a relationship between red blood cell count and weight in male and female athletes?

<details><summary> **Click-me to check your plot choices** </summary>

* Is there a difference between male and female athlete height? - box plot or bar chart
* Is there a difference between male and female athlete weight? - box plot or bar chart
* Is there a difference between male and female athlete red blood cell count? - box plot or bar chart
* Is there a relationship between height and weight in male and female athletes? - scatter plot
* Is there a relationship between red blood cell count and weight in male and female athletes? - scatter plot

If you are unsure about any of the logic behind these choices - please ask a demonstrator 

</details>

Build a draft plot to explore each of your questions.

For your scatter plots add some code to colour the points by sex and add a regression line using `geom_smooth()`. 

> **Pitt Stop; pause your analysis and check your interpretation**
> How would you interpret each of these plots? Write down a sentence or two to describe the pattern displayed in each. Then look at the scatter plot that explores the relationhsip between red blood cell count and weight in male and female athletes. What does the regression line indicate? Is there a relationship between weight and red blood cell count or could there be another variable effecting the relationship? Remember we know the red blood cell count data are bimodal, how might this effect what we are seeing?

<details><summary> **Click-me to check your interpretation** </summary>

Just from glancing at the data, median weight and height are slightly higher in male athletes, this difference is greater when looking at red blood cell counts. There appears to be a positive relationship between weight and height in both males and female athletes, i.e. if we plotted male and female athletes separately, it looks like there would still be a positive relationship between height and weight (we will do this in a moment). When looking at the relationship between red blood cell count and weight in male and female athletes, initially there appears to be a positive relationship, **but** looking at the positioning of male and female points it looks like within each sex the relationship may be less strong. If we think back to our histograms, the red blood cell count data followed a bi-modal distribution, so we need to think about how we explore these data a bit more. In this scatter plot we cant really clearly tell if the variables weight or sex explain most of the variation in red blood cell count. So we need to make some more plots to look at the relationship between weight and red blood cell count in male and female athletes separately. 

</details>

So it looks like we need to tease our scatter plots apart a little more to make sure our understanding of the data is good. Have a go at making plots for the following four questions (make sure you include a regression line);

* Is there a relationship between height and weight in female athletes?
* Is there a relationship between height and weight in male athletes?
* Is there a relationship between red blood cell count and weight in female athletes?
* Is there a relationship between red blood cell count and weight in male athletes?
 
> **Pitt Stop; pause your analysis and check your interpretation**
> Has the relationship changed between weight and height in male and female athletes? Has the relationship changed between red blood cell cound and weight in male and female athletes? Do you understand why it was important to explore these scatter graphs a little more? Do you understand why seeing the bi-modal distribution in our histograms was a clue that we needed to explore red blood cell count in males and females individually? 

<details><summary> **Click-me to check interpretation** </summary>

Essentially, the relationship between height and weight in male and female athletes has not changed, and we didn't really expect it too. By looking at these scatter plots we can see that height explains most of the variation in weight in this data set, makes sense right? Taller people are usually going to be heavier then shorter people. When we look at the relationship between weight and red blood cell count in male and female athletes separately we now see that there is, essentially, no relationship. So weight doesn't explain the variation in red blood cell count, heavier people don't necessarily have more red blood cells. So the positive relationship we saw in our first scatter plot was likely explained by sex not weight.

</details>

So hopefully you can see why its important to think about interpretation at each stage of your analysis, if we had not broken our data set down and analysed male and female athletes separately, we may have ended up drawing false conclusions from our data set. 

## Reporting your analysis

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, this semester we will not only be working on our analytical skills but also thinking about how we report our analyses. Here, we are conducting analysis that will eventually be put into a mock report (to help you prepare for future reports that you may need to produce). So lets begin by thinking about how we might present some of our figures.  

### Task 3 - Start thinking about how you might report your data

First of all, identify which plots you would include in a report if you were interested in answering the following questions;

* Is there a difference between male and female athlete height?
* Is there a difference between male and female athlete weight?
* Is there a difference between male and female athlete red blood cell count?
* Is there a relationship between height and weight in male and female athletes?
* Is there a relationship between red blood cell count and weight in male and female athletes?

> **Selecting plots for a report**
> An extremely common error students make is to include every plot they build in a report. Sometimes it is important to build a plot, as part of your own data exploration, but not include it when writing your report. Histograms are a prime example of this, unless the question you are exploring is related to data distribution, you do not need to include histograms in your project reports. You do need to know how the data are distributed, but you do not need to present the histograms that show the data distribution. Your report should only include figures that relate to the questions you are asking. You want to try and tell a story through your figures, while showing academic rigour. With this in mind, which of your plots would you include in your report, given the questions above?  

<details><summary> **Click-me to see which figures Ellen would present** </summary>

There are several combinations of plots you could present to answer the above questions in a report, but this is how I would do it;

* Figure 1 - A multi-panel (group of plots) figure containing box plots for (i) weight in male and female athletes, (ii) height in male and female athletes and (iii) scatter plot for weight vs height in male and female athletes (pooled)
* Figure 2 - a multi-panel figure containing (i) box plot for red blood cell count in male and female athletes, (ii) scatter plot for red blood cell counts in male athletes, (iii) scatter plot for red blood cell counts in female athletes

We will cover how to make multi-panel figures shortly. 
</details>


Make each figure that you would include in your report visually pleasing. Use your ggplot skills and scripts to do this. Think about colour choices and try to make them uniform.


### Task 4 - Building your first multi-pannel figure

In **Section 13.3.1** I suggested that it may be a good idea to present some of your reported plots in a multi-panel figure. We can make these in R using the package `patchwork`. See the chunk below for a demonstration;

```{r}
# Demonstrating how to use the plot_layout function within the patchwork package to make multi-panel figures
# First, here are some basic plots, you can use your own plots that have been nicely formatted instead, these are just to demonstrate
weight_box <- ggplot(data = athletes,aes(x = sex, y = wt)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
height_box <- ggplot(data = athletes,aes(x = sex, y = ht)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
height_v_weight <- ggplot(data = athletes,aes(x = ht, y = wt)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

# Now we can use the plot_layout function within the patchwork package to make our multi-panel figure.
# Here I have asked for the height and weight box plots to be on the top row, side by side and the height v weight scatter below.
# You can play with the configuration to suit your tastes, use help(plot_layout) to see some other configurations.
# You may notice that here I have specified the package for the function using "::" e.g. patchwork::plot_layout.
# This is because some functions across multiple packages have shared names, as the do here, so R can become confused, by specifying the package, I am directing R to the specific package which contains the specific function I wish to use. 
# The final argument (guides='collect') pulls together all the little figure keys you may have and presents them on one place and should remove duplicated information
(height_box | weight_box) / height_v_weight + patchwork::plot_layout(guides ='collect')
```

The results of this chunk can be seen in Figure 13.1. Note that these are rough draft figures and placement, you can play with the ggplot and patchwork parameters to get them to look as you would like, and as would be expected in a written report. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt= "Results from the patchwork demonstration chunk", fig.cap ="Results from the patchwork demonstration chunk"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/screenshot_patchwork.png")
```

Have a go at putting some of your report ready plots into a multi-panel figure. Use `ggsave` to save all of the figures (multi-panel or single-panel). Check your pdf sizes to make sure they are scaled sensibly, you can change the scaling options by looking at the code chunks in **Section 12**.

## Before you leave!

Log out of posit Cloud and make sure you save your script!
