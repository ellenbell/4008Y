# Portfolio Tasks 

## Background

The data you will be analysing focus on parasite abundance in *Corydoras* catfish.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt= "*Corydoras araguaiaensis*", fig.cap ="*Corydoras araguaiaensis*"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cory.jpg")
```

*Corydoras* catfishes were collected from Brazil and identified. Each fish belonged to one of two species that are very similar in life history but have dramatically different genome sizes. *Corydoras araguaiaensis* is a polyploid species (probable tetraploid), and *Corydoras maculifer* is a diploid species. The two species are mÃ¼llarian mimics and coexist, sharing a niche, so environmentally they have had very similar experiences.

This prediction was that polyploid fish may carry a higher number of different immune alleles and therefore may be better able to resist parasites than the diploid species. The fish were dissected and number of parasites found within each individual was counted.

## The data

The data you have been provided with can be found HERE ADD LINK, it is also be on blackboard should the download link prove troublesome (blackboard Skills for Biologists > Data Sciences > Data page > catfish_parasite_data.csv). 

The data consist of four variables;

1) sample - this is simply a sample ID with values ranging from 1-61
2) length_mm - standard length in millimetres. Standard length is a method of measurement for fish and is recorded as the distance from the tip of the snout to the base of the tail. 
3) species - either the polyploid *C. araguaiaensis* or the diploid *C. maculifer*
4) parasite_count - a measure of total parasites counted per individual

This data set was adapted from Bell et al., 2020. 

## The tasks

Task 3 and 4 of your Skills portfolio are based in the Data Sciences work you have been doing. Each of these is broken into two parts - each exercise listed below describes the work required to complete each part of the two Data Sciences portfolio tasks. If you wish to know how these sections will be marked, consult the Skills for Biologists Portfolio Rubric on Blackboard. 

### Exercise 1 - plots
You wish to know if there is a link between genome size and parasite load in *Corydoras* catfishes, but you also want to make sure and show that there are no confounding variables affecting (like size) affecting any conclusions you draw from your analysis. So you ask three questions of your data;

1) Is there a difference in length between *C. araguaiaensis* and *C. maculifer*?
2) Is there a difference in parasite abundance between *C. araguaiaensis* and *C. maculifer*?
3) Is there a relationship between length and parasite abundance in *C. araguaiaensis* and *C. maculifer*?

Set up a new R studio project, import the catfish_parasites data and make sure it is clean and tidy. Complete all the checks that you did in Chapter 13 and then you can start exploring the data (Chapter 13 and 14). When you are satisfied with the data quality and appearance you can begin to answer the questions above. Construct a plot to address each of these questions, make if visually pleasing and then combine the three plots into a multi-panel figure. Export this as a pdf, you will be able to download this pdf to your own computer when you are happy with it (you may need to open it in your browser and then click the download button in the top right hand corner of the screen). Present these plots in your portfolio for Task 3. 

### Exercise 2 - figure legend

We have discussed figure legends in lectures, write what you would consider to be a good figure legend underneath your newly made figure within Task 3 of your portfolio. 

### Exercise 3 - justification

Task 4 of your portfolio is divided into two parts, a justification and a proof of programming.The first part is a justification of your work flow. Please briefly bullet point a summary of the process you went through to complete Exercise 1 and why you made the choices you made, this should extend from the point that you downloaded the data set to presenting your final figure. 

### Exercise 4 - proof of programing 

The second part of Task 4 is a proof of programming. Please make a screen grab of one of the chunks of code used to create one of your plots. Make sure we can clearly see the code (an example of a good printscreen is shown in Figure 16.2). 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt= "ggplot chunk", fig.cap ="ggplot chunk"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/code_example.png")
```

Good luck everyone! The final workshop in Week 8 will be a drop in session, so if you are really stuck do feel free to pop by. We can help you with fixing code but cant give you more feedback then that.
